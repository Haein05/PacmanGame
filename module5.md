| Choose Your Own Adventure | X               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas. In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected. For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements. List the unique module requirements below: Write one or more programs in Java that demonstrates some of the following: Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Classes

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module. Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below. You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material? I have selected YouTube videos and Google as my primary sources for learning the technical material. YouTube offers a wide range of tutorials and courses on mobile app development, while Google allows me to search for specific topics and find relevant articles, documentation, and forums for additional help.

2. What is your plan to practice the new material? In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software? To practice new material for the Java Pacman project, I will first build a strong foundation in Java basics, covering syntax, data types, and control structures through online tutorials and beginner courses. Next, I'll learn about object-oriented programming and game development libraries in Java before starting the project.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)? At the end of the Sprint, I plan to submit a functional prototype of the Pacman game. This demonstration will highlight the foundational elements of the game and set the stage for further development and refinement.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
   M: 3-5PM Home W: 3-6PM Home T: 3-5PM Home F: 3-5PM Home S:1-2PM Home

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint. What is your mitgigation plan? Integration issues between game components could cause bugs. Test each component individually and use version control to manage changes.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint.

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project. Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting. Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review). You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

| Date    | Start Time | IM or TP | Description               | Hours:Minutes |
| ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| June 24 | 2:15       | IM       | study for code            | 2H 30Mins     |
| June 25 | 4:00       | IM       | start to make my own code | 1H 30Mins     |
| June 27 | 10:30      | IM       | make script for Kotlin    | 2H            |
| June 28 | 11:30      | IM       | study for code            | 1H            |
| June 29 | 5:00       | IM       | developing code           | 2H            |

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/Haein05/PacmanGame

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWpczmXwPeY

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

| Question                                                     | Response |

| Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module? |   Yes       |
| Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                    |   Yes       |
| Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                   |   Yes       |
| Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder?  |   Yes       |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did. If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge. 
 I did not complete a Stretch Challenge for this module.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint? If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
I did not change my selected module during the middle of the Sprint.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

| Activity          | Total Hours:Minutes |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Individual Module |     12H 20Minutes   |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint? What did not work well? List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint. 
Setting specific, achievable goals for each day helped maintain focus and productivity. Some tasks took longer than expected, causing minor delays in the overall timeline.
