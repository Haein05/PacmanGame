## Overview

**Project Title**: Pacman Master

**Project Description**: Pacman Master is a modern rendition of the classic Pacman arcade game, developed using JavaScript.This project demonstrates proficiency in web development, particularly in creating interactive and engaging browser-based games.

**Project Goals**: Faithfully reproduce the classic Pacman gameplay while incorporating modern web development techniques to ensure a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Ensure all necessary files are present in the project directory.
2. Once the pacman.html file is open in your browser, the game will start automatically.
3. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control Pacman.

Instructions for using the software:

1. You will see the Pacman game interface with Pacman, ghosts, and the maze.
2. Avoid the ghosts to stay alive. If Pacman collides with a ghost, you will lose a life.
3. Pacman starts with a set number of lives (typically three).

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

- Text Editor/IDE: A code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any other preferred text editor.
- Git: Git for version control to clone the repository (latest version recommended).
- I can use tools like Live Server for Visual Studio Code to run a local development server for live reloading and testing.
